Arduino library that controls BetaBrite signs over a serial connection.

You will need a simple serial driver circuit.

The venerable [MAX232](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAX232) will do nicely.

Note that the reference manual which led to this work is the Alpha Sign Communications Protocol which can be found [here](https://alpha-american.com/alpha-manuals/M-Protocol.pdf) It's at revision F as of this writing (5 June 2019) which hasn't been updated since 2006, so it would appear to be pretty stable.
